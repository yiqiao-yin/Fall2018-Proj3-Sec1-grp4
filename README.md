## Project Summary  

In this project, we created a classification engine to enhance the resolution of images. To do so, we will carry out model evaluation and selection for predictive analytics on image data. 

We started out with a set of [1500 pairs of images](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7agsll3t5t7spkr/train_set.zip?dl=0). For each pair, we have a high-resolution image that serves as the *ground truth* and a down-sampled low-resolution image as the *input* for the learning task. 
Our learning goal was to produce a *predicted* high resolution image as *output* based on the low-resolution input that is as close to the *ground truth* as possible. 

We were tasked with creating a program that can **enhance the resolution of blurry and low-resolution images**. 

The portability of this program (holding storage and memory cost) as well as the computational efficiency (test running time cost) are a great concern, so we needed to find a balance between the complexity of variables/features/models used and our predictive performance. 

There already exists a current practice using boosted decision stumps on neighboring pixels and the R package gbm is used to implement this classifier.

Our **task** for this project is to
1) implement the *current* practice as the *baseline model* of our system
2) implement an improvement to the current practice. To do this, we used a linear regression model and an xgboost model.
3) evaluate the performance gain of our proposed improvements against the baselines.

We want to thank Professor Ying Liu and Professor Tian Zheng for hosting lectures of Advanced Data Science this semester. It is with transcending gratitude that we announce here what an inspiration both professors have been throughout our experience of building this shiny app. Their knowledge, understanding and genuine “care” for others is illuminated in everything they do! We, Group 4, are in forever debt for their teachings. Moreoever, we also want to thank to TA, Chengliang Tang. There is not enough we can say about how much we thank heaven that he is our teaching assistance. His patience and understanding are unsurpassed. We are grateful for being his students.
